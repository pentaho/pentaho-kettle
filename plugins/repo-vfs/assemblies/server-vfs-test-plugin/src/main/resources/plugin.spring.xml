<!--
This is a Spring file that defines how Pentaho system objects are created and managed.
An implementation of IPentahoObjectFactory, such as WebSpringPentahoObjectFactory, is
responsible for serving objects to callers based on this file.
Possible values for scope attribute:
*singleton* - each request for this object returns the same instance
*prototype* - each request for this object returns a new instance
*session* - each request for this object within a session returns the same instance
default-lazy-init is set to true since some of these object make calls into
PentahoSystem which is initialized after Spring
