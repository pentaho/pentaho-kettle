Big data drivers are not included by default. You are required to download the drivers
individually from the support portal, if desired. The support portal is available at
https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us. After downloading a big data driver, unzip the
archive, run the installer, add the resulting .kar file to this directory and then
restart the application.

If you would like the Pentaho Data Integration to read the files from a different location,
copy the driver Kar files to the desired location and change the value of the SHIM_DRIVER_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
property within the kettle.properties file to the full path of the location where the Kar files were placed.
