
WELCOME TO KETTLE!
------------------

Thank you for using Kettle.

To get started, look in the [docs] directory for the file [Spoon-2.1.pdf].
In it, you'll find an installation description and a user manual for Spoon.

Basically, what it comes down to is:

1) Download/Install Java Runtime Environment 1.4.1 or higher
2) Run Spoon.bat on Windows, spoon.sh on Unix or MacOS.

We really hope you will find Kettle useful in your daily work.
