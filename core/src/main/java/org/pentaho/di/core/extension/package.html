This package provides the basis of the Kettle Extension Point system, which allows plugins to provide code that is executed
whenever the kettle system reaches a certain point in its execution, e.g. when a transformation is started or finished,
or when a file is opened, etc. Adding new extension point types requires adding them to the KettleExtensionPoint enum and then
calling the ExtensionPointHandler to invoke the extension point at the appropriate time.
